# CS61C-Computer-Architecture

This repository contains all the project work from CS186 Introduction to Database Systems, taken at UC Berkeley in Fall 2018. 


Course description:
The internal organization and operation of digital computers. Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching). Elements of computer logic design. Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions. 


Any duplication, reproduction or copying any part of the code and/or the entire code (including current UC Berkeley students taking the course) without my permission is strictly against UC Berkeley code of conduct (for UC Berkeley students), and can and will count as plagiarism (for everyone). I hold no responsibility should a student (or any other individual) be caught plagiarizing and/or using my code as reference, as the code is made public solely for my professional growth.
